# Checkpoint 3 — Rooftop Silence

The air was thin, the skyline jagged.  
Each log, each note, each file has been my only map.  

But not all fragments belong here.  
Some slipped into a place where *essays live*.  
A place designed for longer reflections.  

If you can trace me by this name — **@ryohei20arisu** —  
you’ll find the writings I left behind.
