# Checkpoint Log #3  
Date: 2023-09-17  
Location: Shibuya Arcade

I reviewed the logs again. Something about the last symbol —
it wasn’t part of the game, but a pointer.

It reminded me of where I wrote longer reflections and kept a journal:  
a place for longer notes, essays and fragments of thinking — my public journal.

If you want the next checkpoint, find my journal entries under the handle: Ryoheiarisu
