# Checkpoint 2 — Abandoned Arcade

Long nights watching tokens fall into machines.  
Some fell through the cracks. Others stacked in secret vaults.  

I scribbled:  
“Look beyond the scraps. Some stories need more space.”  

That was the moment I began keeping a parallel record — essays in another public corner.  
The same name I carry here. Search, and the trail continues.
