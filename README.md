# Border Game — Checkpoint #4

Fragments, receipts, and traces from the games I survived.  
Each checkpoint is a marker on the path — follow carefully.  

Some notes go deeper than these scraps.  
When words alone couldn’t carry the weight, I left longer reflections elsewhere.  
If you know my name, you already know where to look.
